# **Build a Travel Weather Planner**

For this lab, you will use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the weather, the distance to travel, and the availability of a vehicle.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should create the following variables:
  - distance_mi (a number representing the distance to travel in miles)
  - is_raining (a boolean representing if the user is currently experiencing rainy weather)
  - has_bike (a boolean representing if the user has a bicycle)
  - has_car (a boolean representing if the user has a car)
  - has_ride_share_app (a boolean representing if the user has an app that allows them to request a ride)

2. You should use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the values of these variables.
3. You should use if, elif, and else statements to evaluate the distance categories in ascending order.
4. If distance_mi is a falsy value:
- You should print False.
5. If the distance is less than or equal to 1 mile:
- You should print True only if it is not raining.Otherwise, you should print False.
6. If the distance is greater than 1 mile and less than or equal to 6 miles:
- You should print True only if the person has a bike and it is not raining. Otherwise, you should print False.
7. If the distance is greater than 6 miles:
- You should print True if the person has a car or has a ride-share app. Otherwise, you should print False.
